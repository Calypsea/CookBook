<h3>The Idea: </h3>
<p>CookBook is a simple yet intuitive website, with a purpose of helping you choose your next meal. It is written using React JSX, CSS. By filling out a small questionaire, choosing your preferred cuisine, diets and ingredients, the site communicates with the SpoonacularAPI and receives 3 recipes. If they are not to their liking, a button appears that allows the user to try again and reroll the recipes.</p>

<p>This is a private project, created to practice my knowledge of React. The website is not meant for commercial use, the name is not copyrighted and all of the icons come from www.icons8.com. </p>
